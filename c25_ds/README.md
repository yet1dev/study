# Logical Set Chain: Data Structure

This project is a data structure to get sequential logical operations
over a set of objects. This structure allow find a object with the
value of a arbitrary property and filter with new searchs.

Originally, this project was made in Java to intregate with other
academic work of Programming 2 Class, but i remade it in TypeScript
to simplify explanation in Algorithm Class. With this, i can show all
features in deno repl and dont need LBox class.

I can transpile my code to JavaScript and use it in Web-Projects.
